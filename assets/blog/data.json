                "So, this program literally only took less than a week to create so it's okay I guess, not perfect, but does the job though. The converter grabs every MIDI note and converts it to a tone integer (in Hertz). At the bottom of this post, I will add a link to where you can find my C# tone dictionary, as well as a download link to the tool. The UI is like an installer, but it isn't. I thought it would be easier for the user in this format (information digestion), instead of getting blasted with information all at once, like <a href=\"https://rufus.ie\">Rufus</a>. I have simplified it down to the point where someone with no experience with a micro:bit can easily import a MIDI, convert it, paste the output code into the IDE and play the Simulator (or you could go a step further and export it to a physical micro:bit!).",
                "There are 2 limitations to this program:<br><ol><li>If the MIDI has a long playing length, it takes a very long time to compile the IDE, and sometimes the code is too long that the micro:bit won't even be able to process the code or even store it on the built-in memory.</li><li>The tool can \"only\" process 1 instrument. I put that in quotation marks because‚Ä¶ well, it can‚Ä¶ but in a bad sort of sense. I'll explain.</li></ol>",
                "The micro:bit can only process 1 tone at a time. This means that there can be no chords or multiple instruments (on a single micro:bit). The tool would process all of the notes as individual notes. Not separate notes or chords. An example of this is when I converted a \"Dr. Dre - Still Dre\" MIDI file. In the song, the epic chords (which the song is known for) turn into quarter notes. Which means the chords are instead played 1 note at a time next to each other. Let's just say it sounds like a mess and sounds terrible.",
                "The reason why I made this tool in the first place was because a couple months ago, I created All Star by Smashmouth on 2 micro:bit, but the thing was that I was inputting the notes manually and in text form, not MIDI input. This caused both micro:bits to become out of sync very quickly because I was using the simulator initially and I didn't pay attention to the timing good enough.",
                "So that caused me to create this tool. Just to make things easier. And with the note definitions code, this could branch off into many other things such as a synthesiser using tones and custom sounds, or even making your own micro:bit piano!",
